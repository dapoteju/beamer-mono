I want you to properly implement authentication and user management in my backend.
Here is the context of my system so you set it up correctly:

SYSTEM CONTEXT

This project is called Beamer, an OOH CMS + Player system.

Backend is in the backend/ folder.

Frontend (CMS) is in cms-web/.

The database has already been migrated and contains tables like:

organisations

screens

regions

campaigns

creatives

flights

bookings

invoices

creative_approvals

BUT it currently has NO users table and no authentication implemented.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO BUILD

Please implement a proper authentication system, including:

1. Users Table

Create a new table called users with the following fields:

id (text, primary key)

email (text, unique, required)

password_hash (text, required)

full_name (text)

org_id (text, references organisations.id)

role (text, enum: admin, ops, viewer)

created_at (timestamp)

updated_at (timestamp)

Use Drizzle ORM (or whatever ORM is already used in the project).

2. Create a Secure Auth System

Implement the following backend endpoints:

POST /auth/register

Input: email, password, full_name, org_id, role

Hash password using bcrypt

Generate short text IDs for users (we already use text IDs, not UUIDs)

Store user in DB

POST /auth/login

Input: email, password

Validate credentials

Return JWT + user object

JWT should contain: user_id, org_id, role

GET /auth/me

Should read Authorization header

Verify JWT

Return full user object

POST /auth/logout

(You can make this a no-op since JWT is stateless.)

3. Add JWT Middleware

Create middleware to verify JWT for protected routes.
It should attach req.user with: { id, email, org_id, role }.

4. Seed an Initial Internal User

Please create 1 initial user in the DB automatically:

org_id: the Beamer internal organisation (create one if not exist)

email: admin@beamer.com

password: beamer123

full_name: Super Admin

role: admin

This allows us to log into the CMS immediately.

5. Make Sure It Integrates With Existing System

Important requirements:

Do NOT break existing backend routes.

Do NOT modify other tables unless required.

Keep the existing organisation logic intact.

Ensure the /auth/* routes follow the same Express style as the rest of the backend.

Use environment variable JWT_SECRET for signing tokens.

6. Expose Types

Export TypeScript interfaces/types for:

User

Auth Response

JWT Payload

So CMS can consume them safely.

7. Confirm Integration

After implementing:

Confirm migrations run

Confirm /auth/register works

Confirm /auth/login works

Confirm /auth/me works using JWT

Confirm initial admin user can log in

Tell me the API URLs I should use in the CMS
