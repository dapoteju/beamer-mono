I now have authentication and org-type–aware navigation working in cms-web, with roles and org types coming from the backend. I want you to implement the Organisations management UI and backend API end-to-end.

Here’s what I need you to do:

Backend – Organisations API

In the backend, create REST endpoints for organisations:

GET /organisations – return a list of all organisations with:

id, name, type, country, billing_email, created_at

GET /organisations/:id – return a single organisation by id, including:

basic fields above

(optional) a list of related screens, campaigns, or bookings if that’s easy

Protect these routes so that:

Only users belonging to an org with type beamer_internal and role admin or ops can call them.

Other users should get 403.

Use the existing auth/JWT middleware you just implemented so the CMS can pass the token.

Frontend – Organisations List Page

In cms-web, update the Organisations page so it no longer shows placeholder text.

It should:

Call the new GET /organisations endpoint using the existing auth token.

Show the results in a table:

Columns: Name, Type, Country, Billing Email, Created At.

Type should be rendered as a badge (same colour scheme as the sidebar/org-type badges you just implemented: Internal = cyan, Advertiser = green, Publisher = orange).

Show a loading state and an error state.

Clicking on an organisation row should navigate to /organisations/:id.

Frontend – Organisation Detail Page

Create a new page at route /organisations/:id.

It should:

Fetch GET /organisations/:id.

Display:

Name, type, country, billing_email, created_at in a summary card.

A tabbed or sectioned layout with:

“Overview” tab: just the basic info.

(Optional but nice) “Screens” tab: if backend returns related screens, show them in a table.

(Optional) “Campaigns” tab for advertiser orgs if easy.

This route must be protected in the same way as /organisations (internal org only).

Respect Org-Type Nav & Guards

Make sure the existing org-type based navigation and guards remain intact:

Only internal org users see the “Organisations” nav item.

If an advertiser or publisher tries to manually navigate to /organisations or /organisations/:id, they should be redirected back to /dashboard.

Developer Experience

Reuse whatever HTTP client / React Query / token handling you already set up in cms-web.

Keep the UI consistent with the existing layout and Tailwind styling.

When you’re done, tell me:

Which files you changed.

What API URLs the CMS is now using for organisations.
