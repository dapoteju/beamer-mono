You are helping me extend the Beamer CMS frontend.
The backend already supports full Bookings CRUD.

🎯 Goal of this task

Inside the existing Campaign Detail page, replace the current Bookings placeholder with a complete MVP Bookings management panel:

The UI must support:

Viewing bookings for a campaign

Creating bookings

Editing bookings

Use modals or drawers (consistent with the Flights UI you just built).

📌 1. Data Source

Backend endpoints:

GET /api/bookings?campaignId=:campaignId
POST /api/bookings
GET /api/bookings/:id
PUT /api/bookings/:id


Bookings fields follow the backend types:

billingModel: "fixed" | "cpm" | "cpd" | "share_of_loop"

rate (number)

currency ("NGN" | "USD" | "GBP" | "EUR")

agreedImpressions? (optional)

agreedAmountMinor? (optional)

startDate (date)

endDate (date)

status: "pending" | "active" | "completed" | "cancelled"

advertiserOrgId (should be attached automatically based on campaign)

campaignId (passed automatically)

Follow the same permission model as campaigns:

Advertisers → see only their own bookings

Internal users → see all

📄 2. Bookings Tab UI Requirements

Inside the Campaign Detail page, replace the placeholder with:

A Bookings Table:

Columns should include:

Billing Model

Rate (formatted with currency)

Start Date

End Date

Status (badge)

Actions (edit)

Add “New Booking” button:

Top right corner of the bookings tab.

Empty State:

If no bookings exist:

No bookings have been added for this campaign yet.
[Add Booking]

📝 3. Create Booking Modal

Fields required:

billingModel (select: fixed, cpm, cpd, share_of_loop)

rate (number input)

currency (select: NGN, USD, GBP, EUR)

agreedImpressions (optional number)

agreedAmountMinor (optional number)

startDate (date)

endDate (date)

status (pending, active, completed, cancelled)

Behavior:

Form should auto-attach:

campaignId (from URL)

advertiserOrgId (derived from the campaign detail API response)

After successful POST:

Close modal

Refetch bookings list

✏️ 4. Edit Booking Modal

Triggered from "Edit" button on each row.

Fields same as Create modal, pre-filled.

Submit → PUT /api/bookings/:id

On success:

Close modal

Refresh bookings list

🎨 5. Styling Requirements

Use same modal/form styling as Flights modals.

Use same table component as Campaign/Flights lists.

Use same badge component for status colors:

pending → yellow

active → green

completed → blue

cancelled → red

🔐 6. Permissions

Respect the same logic as campaigns:

Advertiser users can only manage bookings belonging to their org.

Internal users can view & edit all bookings.

If needed, surface advertiserOrgId from campaign detail response.

📦 Deliverables

Replit should produce:

A complete Bookings tab UI:

Table view

Create booking modal

Edit booking modal

API integration using React Query
