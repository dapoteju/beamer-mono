The backend now has full support for Creatives (media assets) and file uploads, with these endpoints:

POST /api/uploads – upload file, returns file_url, mime_type, etc.

GET /api/campaigns/:campaignId/creatives – list creatives for a campaign

POST /api/campaigns/:campaignId/creatives – create a creative

PATCH /api/creatives/:id – update a creative

DELETE /api/creatives/:id – delete a creative

I need you to add a proper CMS UI to manage Creatives under a Campaign.

🔍 1. Find the Campaign Detail Page

Locate the existing Campaign detail view in the frontend (React/TypeScript).

This is the page where I can see a single campaign’s info and reporting.

It might be something like CampaignDetail.tsx, CampaignPage, or a route like /campaigns/:id.

Once you find it, add a new tab/section called “Creatives” in the campaign detail view, alongside the other sections/tabs (e.g., Summary, Reporting, Flights, etc., if they exist).

🧾 2. Creatives List UI

Inside the Creatives tab for a given campaign:

Call GET /api/campaigns/:campaignId/creatives when the tab loads.

campaignId should come from the current route / campaign context.

Render the result in a table or card list. For each creative, show:

name

a small preview:

if mime_type starts with image/, use <img src={file_url} />

if mime_type starts with video/, use a small <video src={file_url} /> (muted, no controls or minimal controls)

duration_seconds

width x height

status (e.g. pending_review, approved, rejected) as a colored badge

regions_required (comma-separated list of region codes)

Handle loading and error states:

Show a loading spinner/skeleton while fetching.

Show a simple error message if the API call fails.

If there are no creatives, show an “empty state” message like:

“No creatives added yet for this campaign.”

Define and reuse a Creative TypeScript type based on the backend shape:

export interface Creative {
  id: string;
  campaign_id: string;
  name: string;
  file_url: string;
  mime_type: string;
  duration_seconds: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  status: 'pending_review' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | string;
  regions_required?: string[]; // or unknown;
  created_at: string;
}

⬆️ 3. “Add Creative” Flow (Upload + Create)

In the Creatives tab, add a primary button at the top:

“Add Creative”

When clicked:

Open a modal / drawer with a form:

name (text input, required)

file (file input, required)

duration_seconds (number input, required)

optional regions_required (e.g. a comma-separated text input or tags)

When a file is selected and the user submits:

First, upload the file to POST /api/uploads using FormData:

field name should be file to match the backend.

Use the response to get:

file_url

mime_type

Then call:

POST /api/campaigns/:campaignId/creatives with JSON body:

{
  "name": "<from form>",
  "file_url": "<file_url from upload>",
  "mime_type": "<mime_type from upload>",
  "duration_seconds": <from form>,
  "width": <optional: can be null or 0 for now>,
  "height": <optional: can be null or 0 for now>,
  "regions_required": ["NG", "KE"] // or derived from form if provided
}


When this succeeds:

Close the modal

Refresh the creatives list

Show a success toast/notification if such a pattern exists.

While uploading / creating:

Disable the submit button

Show a loading indicator in the button if possible.

Note: If it’s easy to detect width/height on the frontend (for images/videos), do it; otherwise, just send placeholder values and keep the code clean and simple for now.

✏️ 4. Edit & Delete Creatives

In the creatives list, add actions for each row:

Edit

On click, open a modal or inline editing UI where the user can change:

name

status (pending_review, approved, rejected)

regions_required (if present)

Call PATCH /api/creatives/:id with only the changed fields.

On success, update the list (or refetch) and close the modal.

Delete

Add a small “Delete” or trash icon button.

Show a confirmation dialog: “Are you sure you want to delete this creative?”

On confirm, call DELETE /api/creatives/:id.

On success, remove it from the list or refetch.

Handle errors gracefully with inline messages or toasts.

🧩 5. Integration & Code Organisation

Put the Creatives UI into a separate component if the campaign detail page is already large, e.g.:

CampaignCreativesTab.tsx or similar.

Reuse existing shared UI primitives: buttons, modals, tables, badges, toasts, etc.

Reuse the existing API client/utilities (if there’s a central apiClient or fetchJson helper, use that instead of raw fetch everywhere).

✅ Deliverables

When you’re done, tell me:

The file path(s) of:

The updated Campaign detail page

The new Creatives tab component (if created as a separate file)

How to navigate in the CMS UI to reach the Creatives tab for a campaign.

Any assumptions or TODOs you left as comments in the code.

Make sure the code compiles and the Creatives tab actually loads creatives from the backend and lets me add/edit/delete them end-to-end.
