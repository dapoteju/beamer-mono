You are helping me build out the Campaigns & Flights UI inside the Beamer CMS frontend.

Context

Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite.

The backend now includes fully working endpoints for:

Campaigns

Flights

Bookings

You have already built:

Authentication

Navigation layout

Inventory screens (screen list + map view)

I now need full Campaign Management in the CMS UI.

🎯 Goal of this task

Create a complete CMS UI for:

1. Campaigns List
2. Campaign Create/Edit
3. Campaign Detail
4. Flights List & Create/Edit inside campaign detail

This should connect to the new API endpoints I just finished.

🗂️ 1. Create CMS Routes

Add the following routes:

/campaigns
/campaigns/new
/campaigns/:campaignId


Examples:

/campaigns → List view

/campaigns/new → Create campaign form

/campaigns/123 → Campaign detail view (includes flights)

Add “Campaigns” to the main navigation.

📄 2. Campaigns List Page

Create a page at /campaigns that:

Displays a table with:

name

status (with colored badge)

startDate

endDate

totalBudget + currency

Controls:

Search bar → filters ?search

Filter dropdown → status: All | Draft | Active | Paused | Completed

“New Campaign” button → /campaigns/new

Data Source:
GET /api/campaigns?status=&from=&to=&search=

📝 3. New Campaign Form (Create)

At route /campaigns/new, create a form with fields:

name (required)

objective (optional)

startDate

endDate

totalBudget

currency (default “NGN”)

status (draft/active/paused/completed)

targetingJson (simple textarea for now)

On submit:

POST /api/campaigns


Redirect to /campaigns/:id.

🔍 4. Campaign Detail Page (/campaigns/:id)

Layout:

Header section

Campaign name

Status badge

Dates & budget summary

“Edit Campaign” button

Tabs or sections:

Overview

Flights

Bookings (placeholder for now)

Data Source:
GET /api/campaigns/:id


The backend returns:

Campaign fields

Flights

totalImpressions (from stats)

🛫 5. Flights Section (inside Campaign Detail)

Inside the Flights tab:

Display flight table:

name

startDatetime

endDatetime

targetType (screen | screen_group)

targetId (raw ID for now)

status

Add:

“Add Flight” button

Edit button for each flight

Flight creation form fields:

name

startDatetime

endDatetime

targetType: "screen" or "screen_group"

targetId (text input is fine for MVP)

status: scheduled | active | paused | completed

API:
GET /api/campaigns/:campaignId/flights
POST /api/campaigns/:campaignId/flights
PUT /api/flights/:id
PATCH /api/flights/:id/status


Make sure flights update correctly and refresh the list.

🔒 6. Permissions

Use the existing auth context:

Advertiser org users only see their campaigns

Internal users see all

If needed, implement org_id filtering by passing query params

🎨 7. Components

Reuse existing UI components:

Table

Button

Modal / Drawer

Form inputs

Badge

Date & datetime pickers

Keep visual style consistent with screens & inventory pages.
