You are helping me extend the Beamer CMS frontend to add Proof-of-Play reporting for campaigns.

Context

Stack: React + TypeScript.

Backend already exposes reporting endpoints with optional date ranges. For campaigns, the endpoint shape is:

GET /api/reports/campaigns/:campaignId?startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD

It returns (or can easily be adapted to return) something like:

{
  campaignId: string;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  totalImpressions: number;
  byScreen: { screenId: string; screenName?: string; impressions: number }[];
  byDay: { date: string; impressions: number }[];
}


We already have:

Campaigns list and detail pages

Flights and bookings tabs

Auth + org scoping

Play events & reporting logic working on the backend

Goal of this task

Create a Reporting → Campaigns UI that lets an internal or advertiser user:

Select a campaign

Pick a date range

See a summary of Proof of Play:

Total impressions

Impressions by day

Impressions by screen

This should be read-only and focused on clarity, not fancy charts (MVP first).

1. Navigation & Routing

Add a new top-level nav item in the CMS sidebar:

Label: Reporting

Icon: reuse an existing generic analytics icon if available

Under Reporting, add a route:

/reporting/campaigns → “Campaign Reporting” page

You don’t need nested routes yet; a single page is fine.

2. Campaign Reporting Page ( /reporting/campaigns )

Layout structure:

A. Filters Panel (top of page)

Campaign selector:

For internal users:

A searchable dropdown listing all campaigns (name + advertiser)

Data from GET /api/campaigns?status=active (or all statuses if easier)

For advertiser users:

Only their own campaigns

Date range picker:

Two inputs: startDate and endDate

Default: last 7 days, or the entire campaign period if you can easily get it from the selected campaign

“Load Report” button to trigger fetch

B. Summary section

Once a campaign + date range are selected and data is loaded:

Show key metrics in simple stat cards:

Total Impressions

Date Range (start → end)

Number of Screens that recorded impressions

C. Breakdown sections

Two sub-sections below the summary:

By Day

Table:

Date	Impressions

Data from byDay array (sorted ascending by date)

By Screen

Table:

| Screen Name (or ID) | Impressions |

Use screenName if available, otherwise show screenId

Sort descending by impressions

3. API Integration

Create a small API helper in something like cms-web/src/api/reports.ts:

getCampaignReport({ campaignId, startDate, endDate })

Calls GET /api/reports/campaigns/:campaignId?startDate=...&endDate=...

Returns typed data (create proper TypeScript interfaces)

Use React Query (TanStack Query) for:

Fetching the campaign list for the dropdown

Fetching the report when:

A campaign is selected

AND both dates are set

AND the user clicks “Load Report”

4. Bonus UX (if simple to add)

If easy, also:

Add a “View Report” button in the Campaign Detail header that navigates to:

/reporting/campaigns?campaignId=:id

and preselects that campaign in the reporting page.

5. Permissions

Respect existing auth context:

Advertiser org users → only see their own campaigns in the dropdown and only load reports for their campaigns.

Internal users → can see all campaigns and load reports for any of them.

You can reuse the same logic used in the Campaigns list for scoping.

6. Deliverables

New Reporting navigation item.

New /reporting/campaigns page with:

Campaign selector

Date range inputs

“Load Report” button

Summary stat cards

“By Day” table

“By Screen” table

New reports.ts API helper with typed responses.

Optional: “View Report” button from Campaign Detail to this page with preselected campaign.
