You are editing my Beamer backend + CMS project on Replit.
Right now, the Region table contains state-level entries (e.g., Lagos State, Rivers State), but according to the Beamer MVP spec, Regions must be country-level regulatory jurisdictions (e.g., Nigeria = NG, Kenya = KE).

I need you to convert the Region system back to country-level, update seeds, and update the CMS dropdown.

🔧 BACKEND CHANGES
1. Update Region seed data

Remove all existing state-level regions from the DB seed/migrations.

Replace them with a clean country-level region set:

[
  { name: "Nigeria", code: "NG", regulator_name: "ARCON", requires_pre_approval: true },
  { name: "Kenya", code: "KE", regulator_name: "KFCB", requires_pre_approval: true },
  { name: "Ghana", code: "GH", regulator_name: "GACA", requires_pre_approval: false },
  { name: "South Africa", code: "ZA", regulator_name: "AR", requires_pre_approval: false }
]


Insert them using a proper seeding or default migration.

Ensure no state-level regions remain.

2. Add a DB cleanup migration

Create a migration that:

Deletes all rows where code contains a dash (e.g., NG-LA, NG-RI).

Ensures Region table is clean and only has the new entries.

3. Update validation logic

Ensure any backend logic expecting regions (Creative creation, CreativeApproval creation, Screen.region_id validation) accepts only country-level codes.

No state-level codes should pass validation anymore.

4. Creative creation fallback logic

If the frontend does not send regions_required, default it automatically to the campaign-level regions in targeting_json.regions.

This matches the original spec’s intended behavior.

🎨 FRONTEND (CMS) CHANGES
1. Fix the regions dropdown in CreativeFormModal.tsx

The dropdown is currently populated from GET /api/regions, which returns only your 3 state-level rows.

Update it to show the new country-level regions after backend seed update.

Make no other changes to the UI logic — it should work automatically once new region data is coming from the backend.

2. Ensure Edit Creative modal shows the updated regions list

After backend data changes, confirm:

Regions Required shows Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, South Africa

Old codes like NG-LA no longer appear

🧹 CLEANUP
1. Update any existing creatives with invalid region codes

For any creative with regions_required containing NG-LA, NG-FC, etc.:

Replace them with the parent campaign's country region based on:

campaign.targeting_json.regions

OR default to "NG" for now if no targeting exists.

2. Update screens

For every screen whose region_id references a deleted state-level region:

Set region_id to "NG" (Nigeria) by default.

✔️ AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

Print out:

Final list returned by GET /api/regions

Number of creatives updated

Number of screens updated

Confirmation that the Creative “Regions Required” select now shows country names only

File paths modified (backend + frontend)

Make sure everything compiles and the dropdown now displays only:

Nigeria (NG)

Kenya (KE)

Ghana (GH)

South Africa (ZA)
