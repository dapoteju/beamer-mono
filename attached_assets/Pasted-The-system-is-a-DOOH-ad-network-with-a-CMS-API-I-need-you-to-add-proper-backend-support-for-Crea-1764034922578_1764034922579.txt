The system is a DOOH ad network with a CMS + API.
I need you to add proper backend support for “Creatives” (media assets) that belong to a Campaign, following the spec below.

Context

Campaigns already exist in the backend.

A Creative is a media file (image/video) attached to a campaign.

A Flight will later reference one or more Creatives via a joining table.

Tech stack: Node.js/TypeScript backend using Express + Postgres + Drizzle ORM (or whatever ORM you detect in the repo).

What to implement (backend)

Database / ORM models

Check if a creatives table/model already exists.

If not, create one with (or adapt to) these fields:

id: primary key (string or uuid)

campaign_id: FK to campaigns.id

name: string

file_url: string (URL to the media asset)

mime_type: string (e.g. video/mp4, image/png)

duration_seconds: integer

width: integer

height: integer

status: enum or string (pending_review | approved | rejected)

regions_required: JSON or text[] (list of region codes like ["NG", "KE"])

created_at: timestamp default now

Simple file handling

Implement a simple upload endpoint that accepts a file and returns a URL that can be stored in file_url.

For now, storing on the local filesystem is fine (e.g. /uploads/...).

Use something like Multer (or whatever is already used) to handle uploads.

Serve /uploads as a static directory so the CMS can preview media by URL.

Return the full accessible URL in the response.

REST API endpoints for Creatives
Under something like /api/campaigns/:campaignId/creatives implement:

POST /api/campaigns/:campaignId/creatives

Body should support two flows:

Direct URL: { name, file_url, mime_type, duration_seconds, width, height, regions_required }

Upload-first flow: the frontend hits an /api/uploads endpoint to get file_url, then calls this endpoint.

Validate that the campaign exists.

Save the Creative row.

Return the created Creative.

GET /api/campaigns/:campaignId/creatives

Return all Creatives for that campaign.

PATCH /api/creatives/:id

Allow updating name, status, regions_required, and optionally metadata if needed.

DELETE /api/creatives/:id

Soft delete or hard delete, whichever matches existing patterns.

Permissions

Reuse existing auth/authorisation patterns you find in the project.

Only users belonging to the advertiser org that owns the campaign (or Beamer internal) should be able to manage creatives for that campaign.

Testing & docs

Add or update any existing OpenAPI/Swagger typings or TypeScript types used on the frontend, if that pattern already exists.

Make sure the endpoints are reachable and return JSON in a consistent shape with other APIs.

Please implement all of this end-to-end and tell me:

which files you changed

the final endpoint URLs

example request/response JSON for POST and GET creatives.
