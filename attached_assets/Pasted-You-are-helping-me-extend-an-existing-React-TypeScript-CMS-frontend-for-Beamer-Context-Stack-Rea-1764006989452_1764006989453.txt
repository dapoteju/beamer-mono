You are helping me extend an existing React/TypeScript CMS frontend for Beamer.

Context

Stack: React + TypeScript (using whatever component library is already in the project; reuse it).

There is already:

Authentication

A navigation layout for the CMS

Inventory pages (screens, map, etc.)

Backend now exposes:

GET /api/campaigns

GET /api/campaigns/:id

POST /api/campaigns

PUT /api/campaigns/:id

PATCH /api/campaigns/:id/status

GET /api/campaigns/:campaignId/flights

POST /api/campaigns/:campaignId/flights

PUT /api/flights/:id

GET /api/bookings?campaignId=... (for later wiring)

Goal of this task

Create a Campaigns section in the CMS that allows an internal user to:

See a list of campaigns

Create and edit campaigns

Open a campaign detail view that shows:

Campaign core info

Flights for that campaign

A way to add/edit flights

A small panel placeholder for bookings (we’ll fill it in next prompt)

Detailed requirements

Routing & Navigation

Add a top-level route: /campaigns

Add nested route: /campaigns/:id

Make sure “Campaigns” appears in the main navigation (sidebar or header) consistent with existing styling.

Campaigns List Page (/campaigns)

Table or list of campaigns with:

Name

Status

Start date

End date

Total budget + currency

Basic controls:

“New Campaign” button

Status filter (All / Draft / Active / Paused / Completed)

Fetch data from GET /api/campaigns.

Clicking a row takes you to /campaigns/:id.

Campaign Create/Edit

A form for creating/editing campaigns using:

name (required)

objective (optional text/select)

startDate, endDate (date pickers)

totalBudget, currency

status (draft/active/paused/completed)

For create: use POST /api/campaigns.

For edit: use PUT /api/campaigns/:id.

On success, navigate back to the detail page.

Campaign Detail Page (/campaigns/:id)
Layout suggestion (but adapt to existing design system):

Top section: campaign summary

Name, status badge, dates, budget

“Edit Campaign” button

Tabbed or section layout:

Overview

Basic metadata, maybe some key metrics if available

Flights

Table of flights for this campaign

Bookings (placeholder for now)

Just show: “Bookings for this campaign will be displayed here”

Flights Section (within Campaign Detail)

Use GET /api/campaigns/:campaignId/flights.

Show table with:

Name

Start datetime

End datetime

Target type (screen vs screen_group)

Target id (resolved to a label if easy)

Status

Provide:

“Add Flight” button → opens a modal or drawer

Edit action per flight (inline or via modal)

Flight Form Fields

name

startDatetime, endDatetime (datetime inputs)

targetType (select: screen, screen_group)

targetId (for MVP: plain text input or a simple select if you can easily reuse existing screens/groups API)

status (scheduled/active/paused/completed)

Wire up:

Create → POST /api/campaigns/:campaignId/flights

Edit → PUT /api/flights/:id

Important constraints

Reuse existing layout, components, and API helper utilities in the project.

Keep styling minimal but consistent with the rest of the CMS.

Handle loading states and basic error states (simple messages are fine).

Don’t break existing routes (inventory, map, etc.).

Deliverables

New Campaigns list page.

New CampaignDetail page with Flights management.

Navigation updated to include Campaigns.

Brief description of which components/files were created or modified.
